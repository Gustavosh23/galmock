# galmock
This python program adapts hdf5 snapshots of n-body simulations of isolated galaxies that use star formation, such as those from GADGET-4, allowing the plotting of realistic visualizations that take into account metallicity and particle age of the simulated galaxy.

This small program was created to adapt snapshots exported in hdf5 by the n-body simulator GADGET-4, however, it should work with any other program that uses a similar data structure in its hdf5 snapshot.
